## Problem 1
- Scenario: a. Security of checked luggage at Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH)
- Assumptions:
  - Tens, if not hundreds of flights depart and arrive at IAH each day, estimating 1/3 as connecting flights, 1/3 departures, and the last 1/3 as final destination
  - For the sake of planning and consistency, let's say each passenger has at least one checked bag
  - There is bag tracking for each flying group
  - All checked baggage undergoes electronic screening for violations of TSA rules
  - Checked luggage needs to abide by the TSA guidelines for prohibited materials including weapons, bombs, etc.
  - Not every piece of baggage may have a personal baggage lock
  - TSA and airport security has the ability to safely open individual baggage locks for physical searches and will notify the passenger if this is the case
  - Baggage locks that do not abide by the agreements of Safe Skies Luggage Locks may be cut for physical inspection if necessary
  - Baggage will go from the screening section to the correct gate to get loaded onto the plane OR get transported from the plane to baggage claim for pickup
  - Handlers of passenger's luggage are trained employees of the airport, airline, or TSA
  - Lost or damaged baggage is processed through TSA
  - There may be false positives and negatives when screening luggage
- Assets:
  - People are the most important thing to protect. There are plenty of threats to human safety and with travelling already as stressful as it is, ensuring more threats are not introduced is imperative. From the scope of security of checked luggage, the main focus is to ensure that passengers do not bring weapons or explosive devices that can cause harm to other passengers or airport personnel.
  - The other main asset to protect includes the property of the airport and those of the people travelling within it. Certain security measures need to be taken to ensure that harm is not brought to the building, the plane, additional vehicles or equipment needed for transportation. Some would argue that the belongings of people should also be protected since their checked luggage is out of sight for the majority of the passage through the airport, however it does not take precedent over people's lives.
- Threats:
  - The most common threats to airports, especially in checked luggage are weapons or explosives brought by passengers or dropped off at the terminal. There are rules and prohibited items listed that most passengers will heed and avoid but intentional attacks could hold explosive devices in a checked bag that is not inspected until already processed past the front desk. Therefore, there is also the threat of baggage that has not yet been checked but is in the publicly accessed areas of the airport.
  - Similarly, weapons and explosives are not the only threats, but also the intention and threat of robbery and/or theft. Unattended baggage is susceptible to being stolen or items from it may be stolen from anyone passing by. If bold enough, someone could confront or attack a person and steal their personal belongings. Face-to-face robberies are out of the scope of this example but are still considered threats since they are after the personal property or items in personal and checked luggage.
- Countermeasures:
  - For mitigating threats, the most obvious tool is screening checked luggage before it is released from the passenger. Screening methods can include searching by hand which is time and energy intensive or conduct a technology screening using computer tomography/x-ray mechanisms that reflect potential hazardous materials. While the technology may cost more, it is able to process luggage faster and can search compartments that might elude human search. Screening should take place while the luggage is being checked in by the passenger at the front kiosk. Therefore, if there is a threat or possible questioning, it can be removed or mitigated before entering the internal airport system and harming more people and property. 
  - For greater security within and outside the airport, security officials are necessary for accessing threats. Security officials can be located at the gates, security lines before reaching gates, and outside the building so that explosives and weapons are unable to enter into the airport at all. Security officials are also able to conduct identity checks of those travelling and process whether they are reported for domestic or international terrorism.

## Problem 2
- Scenario: b. background checks on future Federal employees
- Assumptions:
  - Our firm is expected to catch instances in which a prospective employee may be a liability or exhibit examples of improper behavior.
  - Steps for the background check should use open-source documentation and request private info when necessary
  - Our firm should have access to information already held by the Federal government including arrest records, tax information, and international interests
  - It is expected to cross-reference information given by the applicant
  - The results of a background check are going to be used and referenced for whether the applicant should be an employee
  - The results of the background check should not show internal bias from the company
  - The background check should check for false credentials, fraud, and potential for unsafe work conditions
  - The prospective employee is aware they are being reviewed for a background check and has complied with the gathering of information about them
  - The results of the background check and information gathered during the process will be protected and preventable from common search
  - The candidate is not able to find what information was gathered about them
- Assets:
  - As a company that provides background checks to the Federal Government, the most important asset is keeping the prospective employee's information private and secure. Any sensitive and identifiable information must be protected and prevented to be used as leverage of any kind. Similarly, there is a responsibility to share potential risks with the government or company hiring the prospective employees. Therefore, information must be shared in a careful manner to protect the employee but satisfy the employer. 
  - Similarly, our company has the responsibility to keep our employee's identity and personal information private from both the employer and employees so that there is no threat of individual backlash in case of not hiring. Since our employees must keep our client's information private, the same curtesy is extended to them.
- Threats:
  - The most prominent threat would be a malicious scammer or attacker wanting to gain private information of our clients. The negligence of employees can also be a possible source of private information being exposed. A leak of private information would weaken the integrity of the company and jeopardize future business trust.
  - A major internal threat to our company would be the misuse of our services by our own employees. If our employees breach the confidentiality of our clients or manipulate the resources available to them for personal use, there is a greater chance of information getting released outside of the organization. Internal threats are more damaging to the trust and quality of the company and are thought to go undetected.
- Countermeasures:
  - In order to keep operations running efficiently and securely, services and tools are restricted to individual research officers. In order to gather information on a person, you must have a code or specific security pass that explains why you are using the system. Maintaining a level of personnel security for need-to-know operations can reduce the opportunity of misuse of resources from employees and can track who is sourcing the information for a case. This also creates a component of security for the client since their information is not viewed by more people than is necessary.
  - To prevent outsider attacks,  software and hardware used by our company needs to be up to date with security protections. By continuously patching vulnerabilities, we limit the chance of info to be leaked or accessed by a malicious user. One option for further security could include automatically deleting gathered information six months to a year after a person's background has been searched. Properly removing or deleting the storage of old reports can limit the amount of information that is available if an attack or breach were to occur.

## Problem 3
- Scenario: Removing personal identifiable information (PII) from phones, tablets, and computers after end of life; When discarding personal electronics, people may not know to wipe their device or remove pertinent information before recycling or throwing it away. This can give a malicious attacker the ability to easily access your passwords and addresses needed to commit fraud and exploit your accounts. This example imagines me as the security officer for a recycling plant for electronics.
- Assumptions:
  - Not every person knows to reset/wipe their devices before disposal
  - Some devices may be corrupted or have the interface damaged so that devices cannot be easily reset
  - Anyone could access your discarded electronics
  - For the sake of this example, we assume some form of PII such as passwords or addresses are stored on at least 1/4 of personal devices
  - We assume users do not completely obliterate the hard drives of their devices before disposal
  - We assume the devices are taken apart either for reuse or to be scrapped for further recycling
  - We assume employees are knowledgeable of electronic components and handling electronic devices
- Assets:
  - This example focuses on ensuring the personal data of users is kept from malicious attackers, therefore protecting and correctly handling user's data is imperative for the success of this project. If there is still PII on the devices, they should be properly wiped to prevent further risk.
  - The other goal for this company is to maintain the physical integrity of the devices if suitable for reused. Therefore, the data should be removed in a way that keeps the device in pristine condition. If the devices will be processed for scrap recycling, the individual components should be intact so that they may be properly melted for reuse. 
- Threats:
  - A possible threat is if someone were to intercept the electronic devices before the recycling company could obtain them. If the devices were located in a public place, anyone could freely take them and tamper as necessary. If the devices are shipped to the facility, there is still the random threat that someone could steal the package and possibly gain access.
  - Another realistic way a user's information could be compromised is if an internal employee were gathering and storing PII to exploit. An employee could steal large batches of devices to resell or take the hard drives from electronics to access and gain PII. Since the devices could be accessed at any point in their disassembly, they are vulnerable until data is cleared.
- Countermeasures:
  - The first protective task to protect user's information is to ask users to properly wipe their devices before recycling. In order to help users take this step themselves, the recycling program should provide up to date information on how to wipe their device. Similarly, there could be a partnership with companies in which users take their devices to a corporate location such as Apple or Dell to have the workers from that company assist in wiping their devices and pass along the devices for recycling.
  - If a device is corrupt or damaged, we can ask users to separate them from other electronics to better assess how to wipe information from their devices and whether components can be recycled or reused. A battery leak could have gotten onto a hard drive and may render it unusable, therefore changing the procedure for wiping the device than if the interface were still active.
  - In case the previous two procedures are not enough for protecting user's data, the company can automatically perform device wiping regardless of whether the user reports they did or not. This ensures that the data is taken off but still poses the risk that it may be intercepted before reaching the facility. Similarly, this task can be outsourced to the corporations that sold the electronics and use the recycling facility purely for taking apart the device.

## Problem 4
- a) Prevention can reduce the number of risks posed and reduce the time, effort, and energy required to fix the issue. An example of prevention includes telling employees not to click on links in emails from unknown senders. If they click a link unknowingly and infect their system with a virus, it may be harder to detect its presence or recover lost data in an attack.
- b) Detection can help notice an attack or threat before action is taken. In a grim example, cancer detection can help give a patient notice of recovery options and make them more aware. A cancer patient may not have been able to prevent the cancer developing and would not know recovery options without its detection. More on topic, malware or virus detection on a computer system can help others be aware of where the threat came from and how to eliminate the threat before data is lost. 
- c) Recovery is a last resort to help see which parts of a system were damaged and whether information can be revived. In a personal example, recovery of an unsaved essay or thesis is essential for time and sanity. Prevention and detection could not apply when a computer crashes and does not automatically save your progress.
- d) Authentication gives a user access to a system or information and can provide accountability when an error occurs. In order to log into your Gmail, you sometimes need to verify your backup email or confirm your phone number in an effort to authenticate that the intended user has access. Prevention, detection, and recovery are subcomponents of authentication since a failed login can notify the owner of the Gmail account to change their password. Using the detection of Gmail's service, they can prevent further attack and ensure the safe recovery of their emails.
- e) Availability ensures that systems are present to access and protect. Without the availability of VPN networks, your computer's location may be more easily traceable or discovered to attackers. Similar to authentication, availability presides over prevention, detection, and recovery since they can only be implemented if a system is available or intentionally unavailable.
