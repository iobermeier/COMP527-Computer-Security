# Problem 1
key=MALLORY

In order to solve a Vigenere cipher without a known key, we first want to find a pattern in the ciphertext
to find how long the key should be. After having the length of the key, we calculate frequency analysis and
deduce the specific letters of the key through trial and error. The specific steps are detailed below.


Using the steps from Wikipedia's Kasiski examination (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasiski_examination)
and an answer from a Quora page (https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-crack-the-Vigenere-cipher-without-knowing-the-key), 
a naive approach was followed by manually looking at the first line of the ciphertext
and finding repeating letters. There are pairs of duplicate letters as well as a pattern of PGE, PHE, PEW in the first line.
However the most successful pattern is seen in the first 10 letters in which we see ZOHESTF ZOW. The repeatition of ZO and then 
some letters might indidcate a pattern that we want to follow. It is assumed that the length of the key is 7 since there are 7 
letters between the first and second 'Z'

Using frequency analysis, we can see the amount of times a specific letter is used in its relative position. Since there was no 
convenient method to conduct this without using online resources, the commented portion of the Python file, "vigenere_decrypt.py"
will compute our frequency analysis. Since this is a naive approach, we can manually print the frequency of each letter by changing 
the variable name of which position we want to see. For example, if we want to see the character frequency in position 4 of the key, 
we set the counter variable to 'fourth'. By printing each of these frequencies, we can gain insight to possible keys.

Example output of the frequency counter for position 4: Counter({'Z': 24, 'E': 23, 'P': 21, 'D': 15, 'T': 12, 'L': 11, 'Y': 10, 'C': 10, 'W': 8, 'S': 6, 'F': 6, 'H': 5, 'O': 3, 'G': 3, 'Q': 3, 'M': 3, 'X': 2, 'A': 2, 'R': 2, 'N': 2, 'J': 1})

Using the highest character frequencies, we get the key: QEPZBKC which when used to decode, outputs gibberish that is not very helpful. 
The output of the first 7 letters is: JKSFRJD . As indicated by the Quora thread, we are now trying to a solve version of a Ceaser 
cipher where each character has a specific offset. Going through offsets for each letter of our key, we see a recognizable English 
word "NOW" in our plaintext output when the offset is 4. With an offset of 4 for all the letters in our key, the new key is MALVXGY
and has an output of "NOWJVNH" for the first seven characters.

Since the first three letters of our key form a word, we want to look the rest of the letters in the key. We assume that the other
letters are incorrect and need to look at the next highest frequencies from our counter. Looking at letter 4 of our key, the next highest
character frequency is 'E' and becomes 'A' with our offset of 4. The key is now MALAXGY with an output of NOWEVNH which could be correct
so we move to the fifth letter of key and apply a similar change in which the second highest character frequecy is F, offset to B with a
plaintext result of NOWERCH which may seem fine but looking to the next set of 7 plaintext letters, we get NOLZTYI which is clearly not a word.
Therefore, we repeat the process of correcting the key with the next highest frequencies from key letter positions 4, 5 & 6 until we get the
key MALLBRY and the output NOWTRCH which when going in order indicates that there is an issue in position 5 since we need a vowel.
By moving to the fourth highest frequency, we can see that the key is S, shifted by 4 to the letter O and cleverly creates the key MALLORY.

Now that we have the key, we subtract the ciphertext's index in the alphabet with the key's index in the alphabet to find the plaintext message:
