## Cryptanalysis
The homework specifications, as well as the corresponding course slide decks,
can be found on the [Comp427 Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/kyd4busq8kh1a5)
This assignment is due **Thursday, February 3 at 6 p.m.**

## Student Information
Please also edit _README.md_ and replace your instructor's name and NetID with your own:

_Student name_: Isabella Obermeier

_Student NetID_: io9

Your NetID is typically your initials and a numeric digit. That's
what we need here.

_If you contacted us in advance and we approved a late submission,
please cut-and-paste the text from that email here._

## Inputs
The homework writeup includes two "inputs" for you. They're also part of this Git repository:
- [input1.txt](input1.txt)
- [input2.txt](input2.txt)

## Outputs
You'll be filling out three templates that we be partially machine graded:
- [P1.txt](P1.txt)
- [P2.txt](P2.txt)

To the extent that this assignment asks you to write code, please make sure the necessary code is checked into your Git repo and refer to it in your written answers. Since you can use any programming language you like, you can assume that we know what to do with Python, but for anything else you should include suitable build systems (e.g., *Makefile* for a C program, *build.gradle* for a Java program) and instructions for how to make everything work. To make our lives easier grading your code, make sure that you additionally cut-and-paste the output of your program into those text files (P1.txt, etc.) such that we can see their output without having to run them.
